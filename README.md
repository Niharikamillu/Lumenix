Create a high-end luxury product image using the first image as the main reference.

PRODUCT DETAILS:
- Keep the handbag upright in a three-quarter front view.
- The full bag should be clearly visible.
- Do not change the hand position or pose.
- Make both sides of the top handle look identical:
  • Add metallic rings on the right side of the handle, matching the left side exactly.
  • The handle attachments should look perfectly balanced on both sides.

CRYSTAL CLARITY (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Improve the bag surface so it clearly looks like it is made from individual glass crystals.
- Each crystal should look solid, clear, and realistic, not like glitter or shimmer.
- Show clear crystal edges, depth, and light reflection similar to luxury crystal clutches.

BRANDING:
- Use the brand name “Lumenix”.
- Place the brand name on the center of the bag.
- The plate should have a soft copper finish.
- Position the branding plate on the bottom-right side of the bag.
- Keep the branding minimal, elegant, and premium.

LIGHTING & QUALITY:
- Use soft studio lighting with gentle highlights.
- Keep the entire bag in sharp focus.
- Do not blur the background.
- Maintain clean edges and realistic textures.

BACKGROUND:
- Use a clean and elegant background similar to high-end product photos.
- Neutral tones that match a luxury fashion brand.

FINAL LOOK:
- The image should look realistic, clean, and suitable for luxury brand marketing.
